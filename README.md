# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

This week's challenge focuses on refactoring code for an existing website to meet accessibility standards. This involves replacing generic elements with semantically appropriate containers, consolidating CSS, and adding alt text to images

Here is the acceptance criteria for the assignment:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

A mockup image is included to show what the final product should look like.
